# Job-Acceptance
Job Acceptance Prediction System is a machine learning project that predicts whether a candidate will accept or reject a job offer. Using candidate skills, experience, and compensation data, the model supports data-driven hiring decisions, reduces offer rejections, and improves recruitment efficiency.
